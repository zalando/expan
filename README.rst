A/B tests (a.k.a. Randomized Controlled Trials or Experiments) have been widely
applied in different industries to optimize business processes and user
experience. ExpAn (**Exp**\ eriment **An**\ alysis) is a Python library
developed for the statistical analysis of such experiments and to standardise
the data structures used.

The data structures and functionality of ExpAn are generic such that they can be
used by both data scientists optimizing a user interface and biologists
running wet-lab experiments. The library is also standalone and can be
imported and used from within other projects and from the command line.
